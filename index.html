    <h1>DACHSHUND THE HOTDOG
    </h1>

        <h2>The dachshund was bred in Germany hundreds of years ago to hunt badgers. "Dach" means badger and "hund" means dog. The three varieties of dachshund, smooth-, wire-,and long-coated, originated at different times. The smooth was the first and arose from a mixture of a miniature French pointer and a pinscher.
<H2>Clever, lively, courageous, entertaining: that’s the Dachshund. The Dachshund’s name comes from the German words for badger (dachs) and dog (hund), but you might know the Dachshund more informally as a doxie, wiener dog, hot dog, sausage dog, or badger dog.
    Dachshunds were originally bred in 15th century Germany to hunt badgers. This dog breed’s long back and short legs made them ideal hunting dogs for scenting, chasing, and flushing out small animals and burrow-dwelling creatures.</H2>
        <H2>Technically, this breed is a scent hound (and you can tell by the way they go after a good smell despite your best efforts to stop them). But they also share some qualities in common with terriers, such as a love of digging and a big personality.
 Their uniqueness, combined with their legendary loyalty to their human companions, consistently makes Dachshunds one of the most popular family pets in the United States. Read on for more about this very special dog, and to learn whether this breed is right for you.

            <H2>Dachshund Appearance                                                                                                            Dachshunds show a wide variety of coloring: black and tan, black and cream, red, blue and cream, fawn and cream, solid black, fawn, chocolate, and red (to name just a few). Dachshund markings include brindle, dapple, double dapple, piebald, brindle piebald, and sable. Dachshund hair can be smooth and short, long, or wiry.

                They also show a difference in temperament based on the characteristics of their coat. Because the wire-haired Dachshunds have terrier in their lineage, they’re often less calm than their long-haired cousins, who are the quietest and calmest of the three types. Dachshunds with a smooth coat tend to have a personality that falls somewhere in the middle.</H2>
<H2>Feisty, Loyal and Playful
    Playful, feisty, stubborn, fond of cuddling…this little dog is a mixed bag. If trained well, Dachshunds can make excellent companions, steadfast family dogs, and even therapy dogs. If not, they can be overwhelming and a little difficult to control.
    
    Like with many dog breeds, it’s good to remember their original purpose, which is to be a hunter’s companion. All those qualities that can make a Dachshund exasperating are what also makes him uniquely gifted.</H2>
<H2>Ideal Pet Parent for a Dachshund
    Dachshund dogs love apartment life. Because of their small size, they don’t need a backyard, but they do enjoy going on walks outside. Dachshunds also love a challenge, and as long as you incorporate plenty of opportunities to chase and find things, you’ll have a happy dog.
    
    These dogs love their human parents, and really don’t want them to leave. Your dog may struggle more with separation anxiety, and when they’re missing you, they’re likely to chew. When you do leave your home without your dog, you may want to use a kennel.
